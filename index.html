                        <p>It started with two friends, an ape and an idea. One being heavily involved in the
                            traditional
                            art
                            market
                            and world renowned museums and the other a professional artist and illustrator full time,
                            both
                            are
                            completely obsessed with crypto and the NFT Space.</p>
                        <p>The Gardener being a BAYC (Mutant) holder and Archer Mccall being a huge fan of the project
                            from
                            inception, asked each other one question. Where are the ladies? From that ‘aha’ moment the
                            two
                            of
                            them
                            got stuck into creating a female version to the legendary ape.</p>
                        <p>In order for the project to be a success the team required a woman’s touch and influence.
                            Although
                            the
                            nft market has grown and a number of women are successfully carving out a niche, the trend
                            of
                            male
                            dominance has also become more apparent. The two made it their mission to recruit a team of
                            talented
                            women with various skill sets to take on this project.

                        <p>What was essential from the beginning is that it will not be another copy and paste
                            derivative in
                            any
                            way. From the character to each trait, every element had to be conceptualized, handsketched
                            and
                            original in its own unique way with some references to female icons.</p>
                        <p>What is apparent is that the original concept has evolved into something much larger. It is
                            said
                            that
                            the brands and companies of today that have no strategy to enter the NFT space are like
                            those
                            back
                            in the late 1990’s that did not have strategies to get involved as early adopters to the
                            internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our goal is to bridge the NFT space with the physical world by working with people, brands
                            and
                            companies. Collaborating and designing custom ApeWives which can then be used on various
                            applications, one for example as the face/ supermodel for a specific line of cosmetic
                            products.
                            This
                            will enable businesses to enter the NFT space not only by investing in an NFT and storing it
                            in
                            their wallet, but by capitalizing on it and benefiting from it.</p>
                        <p>The DAW community will then benefit from this strategy as it will offer our members exclusive
                            access
                            to various tangible and virtual experiences. From discounts at exclusive hotels around the
                            world,
                            access to high end clubs, restaurants and even airline upgrade priority is on the list.</p>
                        <p>Our vision is to create a functional, sustainable and solid membership network so that our
                            community
                            will enjoy the perks of being part of this Exclusive and Unique Club.

                            Last but not least, our roadmap development and activities are first and foremost promoting
                            women,
                            their strong character and leadership capabilities in this new Renaissance. The aim is to
                            address
                            the lack of female representation in Cryptospace. Our team at the Desperate ApeWives
                            celebrates
                            women and looks to collaborate with and promote female NFT artists and entrepreneurs.</p>
